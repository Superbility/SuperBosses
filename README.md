# SuperBosses

Super-Bosses is another minigame event designed for a larger server. A boss will spawn in intervals (6 hours) in which players can co-opertively fight the giant and earn rewards!

First of all the boss is shielded and the players must work together to destroy 4 pillars while fighting off a swarm of mobs being spawned from the pillars!

After all 4 pillars have been destroyed, the giant's shield will be destroyed, leaving it free. Be careful though - the boss has some unique attacks including launching you, tnt rain and slot swapping!

After defeating the mighty beast, a leaderboard will be displayed and rewards will be distributed appropriately between players depending on their leaderboard position!
